## 🧾 Key Insights

- **Revenue Trend**: Overall revenue decreased over time, falling from ~£4,000 to ~£3,000 per quarter.
- **Quarterly Performance**: Q4 consistently underperforms; Q2 shows the most variation.
- **Revenue Per Hour**: Despite falling total revenue, earnings per hour have increased, especially in the last year.
- **Client Concentration**: The top 15 clients (of 138) account for 86% of total revenue.

## ✅ Recommended Actions

- **Retention Strategy**: Investigate why most clients leave quickly. Consider surveying them to gather feedback and address barriers to continued engagement.
- **Client Value Focus**: Develop strategies to retain and upsell the ~15 high-value clients.
- **Lead Generation**: Invest time in reaching new clients, as total revenue is declining even while efficiency improves.
