## 📈 Insights & Charts

### 1. 🚲 Mountain Bikes Are the Profit Drivers

### 2. 🌍 US & Australia Are Top-Performing Regions

- US Southwest leads in total profit.
- Australia has strong profit with relatively low return costs.

### 3. 👛 Low-Income Customers Are the Biggest Spenders

- Most revenue comes from customers in the lowest income bracket.
- This may indicate a loyal budget-conscious market or affordable pricing strategies.

🟢 **Recommendation**: Don’t neglect low-income segments; tailor value bundles or loyalty rewards.

### 4. ❌ Jerseys Perform Poorly

- Jerseys have a high return cost relative to profit.
- Negative profit per return cost indicates they may be a loss leader.

🟢 **Recommendation**: Redesign, reprice, or remove jerseys from the catalogue.

## 📎 Top Recommendations

✅ Focus on **Mountain Bikes** — high margin, low returns  
✅ Scale presence in **Australia** — strong profits per order  
✅ Target **Low-Income Customers** with loyalty programs or bundles  
✅ Consider **discontinuing Jerseys** or reducing return rates via better sizing or product photos

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Create a dashboard (Power BI or Tableau) to explore trends interactively
- Add temporal analysis (e.g. monthly seasonality of returns or revenue)
- Combine RFM segmentation with product performance for deeper customer insights
