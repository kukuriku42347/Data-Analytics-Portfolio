## üìà Key Findings

### 1. **Product Profitability & Returns**  
- Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes show the highest profits and healthy gross margins.  
- Clothing categories (like Jerseys and Shorts) have high return rates and reduce overall profitability.

### 2. **Customer Demographics**  
- Customers with lower income levels generate a substantial portion of sales volume.  
- Occupations such as Professionals and Managers contribute significantly to revenue.  
- Larger family sizes correlate with lower average spending per customer.

### 3. **Regional Performance**  
- US Southwest and Australia show the strongest profitability with moderate return costs.  
- Some regions have high returns negatively impacting net profit.

- Investigate and reduce return rates in **Clothing** through improved sizing and product information.  
- Develop targeted promotions for **lower-income customers** and specific occupations with high spend potential.  
- Expand presence in profitable regions such as **Australia** and **US Southwest**.
